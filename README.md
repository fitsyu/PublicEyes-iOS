# PublicEyes-iOS
A social control system to keep our environment clean.

This is a custom camera application for iOS that is useful to capture photo, scene, time and location of annoying things on street and upload them to a public site.

We mean by annoying things are actions done by irresponsibles like:

- Littering
- Smoking
- Illegal Parking
- Etc

This application is Impactful, Simple, Easy, Practical, Fun and Rewarding.

## Impactful

It provides a way for people to make real action and contribute and involved directly in effort to make better public environment.

## Simple

The flow of usage is completed in just three steps:
1. Capture 
2. Complete
3. Submit

## Easy

The most time consuming part is in Complete step.
Where we have to fill in two fields: What & Who

We use our best to minimize effort necessary to this task.

In `what` field we use predefined options, so we don't have to type manually for common bad actions.

In `who` field we utilize the power of Machine Learning to help us read the text from captured photo.

In our experiences vehicle plat numbers are detected easily.

That is why we believe this should be easy.

## Practical

Interaction with app can be done in many ways. We tried to expand beyond just on-screen buttons!

We can use remote trigger button like headphone's play/pause button.

(Next) We can even use Voice Command to do hands-free capture. Just say 'Capture them'!

See? So practical. right?

## Fun

We can use this application to kill times of boredom in a long journey.

We designed the interaction to be like a capture game i.e Pokemon Go! completed with nice graphics and SFX.

## Rewarding

We want to give you some reward for helping us make the environment clean.

We will create some processes to define the reward you deserve.

Right now, we think we can assert from the accuracy of report submitted and photo and video quality.
